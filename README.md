Automated creation of an Opinion Mining/Sentiment Analysis Classifier Model using Genetic Programming

# Opinion Mining

"Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is the field of study that analyzes peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations, individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes." ([Liu, 2012](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/SentimentAnalysis-and-OpinionMining.pdf))

# Genetic Programming

"Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary computation (EC) technique that automatically solves problems without requiring the user to know or specify the form or structure of the solution in advance. At the most abstract level GP is a systematic, domain-independent method for getting computers to solve problems automatically starting from a high-level statement of what needs to be done." ([Poli, Langdon, McPhee](http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/))
